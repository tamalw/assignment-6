assignment 6
You are going to write a program that meets a couple of qualities.

In both cases, you are going to allow the user to enter a integer number. This number represents the nth number in the sequence defined below.

In the first case, this tells which prime number you are looking for. A prime number is any number that is evenly divisible by 1 and itself and no other numbers. You code should make use of multiple functions. 1 Function should determine if a number is prime. The other function should call this ( from in a loop) until you have found the nth prime number. Your function to determine if a number is prime should have a loop stops as quickly as possible. Remember, once you find that a number is evenly divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, you can quit loop. Also recall, that you only need to check the numbers up to the sqrt of the top value to see if there are any prime factors.

The second function will find the nth Fibonacci number. You MUST use recursion to do this. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of number that begins with the numbers 0 and 1 ( in that number). The next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous 2 numbers.
